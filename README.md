# <UNC Coding Bootcamp: The Prework Study Guide>

## Description

This webpage will assist new coding and web development students on their journey to becoming a professional Web Developer. This webpage contains a list of critical notes that will assist in the creation of student websites and projects. It combines the essentials for the building blocks of a website: HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Git. Through this project, I was familiarized with the most important pieces of web development, and the essential tools I will master over the course of the next 24 weeks and years to come.

## Installation

## Usage

Using the study guide is easy! Simply review the notes in each of the four sections. For a suggestion on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (MacOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will find a list of topics we studied during the prework, as well as a suggestion on which topic to dive into first. Enjoy!
